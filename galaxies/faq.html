      Outpost 77 - Frequently Asked Questions
    </h1>
    <p class="rule-section">
      Outpost 77 is a small, immersive gathering held on private property. Attendance is by invitation only.
      Please do not share the location with others.
    </p>
    <h1 class="rule-section">
      GENERAL EVENT INFO
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>DO I HAVE TO WEAR A COSTUME? <br/>
          Yes. Costumes are required to maintain the immersive environment of Outpost 77.<br/>
          Outfits can be simple or elaborate — think desert travelers, scavengers, mechanics, pilots, settlers,
          smugglers, bounty hunters, gangsters, or alien species of all kinds. You are stepping into a character
          of your own creation in an outpost in a galaxy far, far away.<br/>
          Costumes don’t need to be complicated to be effective. Vests, khaki jackets, ponchos, capes, straps, goggles,
          earth-toned layers, wasteland gear, or Western-inspired silhouettes all fit perfectly.
          A little goes a long way.<br/>
          To preserve the in-world feel, please avoid modern, out-of-universe elements such as printed text,
          logos, ball caps, sportswear, plaid, or anything that clearly comes from Earth fashion.<br/>
          Our goal is for everything on-site to feel as in-universe as possible, ensuring a fully immersive experience
          for you and everyone attending.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ARE CHILDREN ALLOWED?<br/>
          Yes. Children may attend only with direct, hands-on supervision at all times.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CAN I BRING PETS? <br/>
          No pets are permitted. Service animals trained per ADA guidelines are allowed, but should be carefully
          considered due to wildlife risks and difficult terrain.</p>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      TRANSPORTATION AND ARRIVAL
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>IS THE EVENT REACHABLE BY A STANDARD VEHICLE?<br/>
          Yes. The site is accessible by most standard vehicles via a 1.5-mile dirt road. The road is passable but
          uneven, bumpy, and includes areas of soft sand, so please drive slowly and use caution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>IS THERE A CHECK-IN PROCESS?<br/>
          Yes. Because this is a private event, all attendees must check in upon arrival.
          Only confirmed guests will be admitted.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      TERRAIN & ACCESSIBILITY
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>WHAT IS THE TERRAIN LIKE? <br/>
          The site features desert conditions:<br/>
          &nbsp •	Flat but uneven<br/>
          &nbsp •	Sand and dirt surfaces<br/>
          &nbsp •	Occasional rocks, dips, and loose ground<br/>
          &nbsp •	No paved walkways
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>WHAT SHOULD GUESTS WITH MOBILITY LIMITATIONS EXPECT?<br/>
          &nbsp •	The terrain may be difficult for wheelchairs, canes, or other mobility devices.<br/>
          &nbsp •	Buildings each have a step at the entrance; they are not ramped.<br/>
          &nbsp •	Porta potties include standard units and one wider ADA-style unit,
          but none are fully roll-in accessible due to sandy ground.<br/>
          &nbsp •	Navigating after dark requires caution — bring strong headlamps or flashlights.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      AMENITIES & ESSENTIALS
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>ARE THERE BATHROOMS?<br/>
          Yes. Portable restrooms (standard units plus one wider ADA-style unit) are available.

          There is a handwashing station located by the porta potties.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>IS THERE FOOD AVAILABLE? <br/>

          Plan accordingly for minimal connectivity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CAN I TAKE A SHOWER?<br/>

        <p>DO I HAVE TO CAMP?<br/>
          No. Camping is optional. You may stay off-site if you prefer.<br/>
          However, on-site camping is available for an additional per-person fee.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>WHERE CAN I CAMP?<br/>

          &nbsp a.	In-Universe Camping (Pre-Approval Required)<br/>

          &nbsp b.	Quiet Camping<br/>
          &nbsp &nbsp A peaceful area with strict quiet hours. Generators may not be operated during quiet hours.<br/>

        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h1 class="rule-section">

          There is no first aid or medical care provided on-site. All attendees are responsible for bringing their
          own first aid supplies and managing personal medical needs.<br/><br/>
          The nearest hospital is approximately 30 miles from the event site:<br/>
          Antelope Valley Medical Center<br/>
          1600 W Avenue J<br/>
          Lancaster, CA 93534<br/>
          (661) 949-5000<br/>
          <br/>
