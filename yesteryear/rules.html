      GENERAL RULES
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>FAMILY-FRIENDLY EVENT: Yesteryear is a fully immersive themed event for everyone. Minors must be
          supervised by an adult at all times. A government-issued photo ID is REQUIRED for proof of age and entry for
          all adults. No exceptions will be made.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LAWS: All local, county, state, and federal laws apply to the event.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ARRIVALS: The event opens to attendees on Friday. Check-in opens at 10am. Only individuals and groups with prior
          approval and early arrival passes will be permitted to set up before the event is open.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>HARASSMENT POLICY / CODE OF CONDUCT: All members of the Yesteryear community have the right to be treated
          with — and the responsibility to treat others with — dignity and respect. Yesteryear is intended to be safe
          and enjoyable for all attendees; therefore, it is strictly forbidden to discriminate based on race, religion,
          gender, gender-expression or identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or national origin.
          Cyber-bullying will not be tolerated. Additionally, Yesteryear reserves the right to restrict the display of
          any symbols it considers hate symbols at any time.
          <br/>
          Your attendance at one of our events, and your membership in our online community can be revoked at any time,
          at the discretion of our staff, for any reason, with or without notice. Our most important goal is the safety
          and enjoyment of our on-site attendees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ENTRY SEARCH: Yesteryear is a private event and thus reserves the right to search all persons, vehicles,
          and camps at any time. Your vehicle may be searched upon entry to the premises.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>WRISTBANDS: Yesteryear is a private event and requires that wristbands must be worn at all times. If you
          lose your wristband, please report back to the check-in gate with your ID. Do not take your wristband off
          during the event. Wristbands may NOT be transferred from one person to another.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LITTER & TRASH: If you bring it in or make it, you haul it out.  This is a pack-it-in pack-it-out event.
          Please bring trash bags to collect and dispose of the trash from your camp.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ALCOHOL AND MINORS: No alcohol may be served, given, or distributed to minors. If you are caught doing so,
          local authorities will be contacted, and you will be ejected from the event.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>SALES AND SHARING: Only approved vendors are authorized to sell items on premises. Private parties are not
          to sell alcoholic beverages, food, costumes, etc.; failure to comply will result in being expelled from this
          and future events.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LOCAL WILDLIFE: This is a private residence where there will be farm and domestic animals. Please do not
          feed any animals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ASSAULT AND THEFT: Assault or theft is a violation of the law, and local authorities will be called in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>FIREWORKS AND EXPLOSIVES: Please do not bring any fireworks, bottle rockets, live ammunition, or explosives
          of any kind to the event. No road flares may be used (except in case of emergency). </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>DRUGS: This is a drug-free family-friendly event. Possession or use of illicit substances is prohibited by
          law. The possession of any illegal drug with intent to distribute is an even more serious felony offense.
          The possession of large quantities or a variety of drugs may be interpreted as evidence of intent to
          distribute. Possession of drug paraphernalia with the intent to use it to ingest a controlled substance is a
          violation of the law. Giving illegal substances to someone else could be considered drug trafficking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ENTRANCE & EXIT: When entering or exiting the event, please use the check in gate entrance and exit only.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>PERIMETER FENCE: The perimeter fence around Yesteryear is not to be cut, broken, removed, circumvented,
          or altered in any way.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>SIGNS: Please do not remove, take, or alter any of the Yesteryear road signs that direct patrons to the
          event. If caught with one of our event signs in your possession, you will be ejected from the event. It is
          the property of Yesteryear.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>VANDALISM: Vandalism (writing, stickers, paint, scribing into metal, etc.) will not be tolerated.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>FIRE DEVICES: Store-bought (UL-listed) and unaltered 1lb. propane, 8oz butane, or up to 16oz. isobutane
          canisters and other flame devices used for their intended purposes of cooking are allowed. There is also an
          exception for devices used officially by Yesteryear staff that have been inspected and permitted by the fire
          department. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>DRONES & REMOTE CONTROLLED AIRCRAFT: Remote-controlled aircraft (drones or any other type, with cameras or
          without, regardless of size) are not allowed at Yesteryear. The only exception is for video crew who have
          prior written permission specifically for drone filming.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>SOUND SYSTEMS & MUSIC: Attendees are not allowed to bring their own sound system to Yesteryear. This is to
          help preserve the immersive theme and to preserve the enjoyment of other attendees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>THEME: This is a fully-immersive, themed event and period costumes MUST be worn by everyone at all times.
          For more information, please read our comprehensive
          <a href="./assets/pdf/faq.pdf" target="_blank">player packet.</a>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>PHOTOS AND VIDEO: Taking photos and video at Yesteryear has some restrictions, and we do NOT want people
          live-streaming. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      PETS & ANIMALS
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>PETS: Pets are NOT permitted at the event. No dogs, no cats, no reptiles, no insects. NO animals may be brought
          on site. Love your pets? Don’t bring them to Yesteryear (with the exception of genuine ADA service dogs).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ADA ANIMALS: Per Title II and III of the ADA, exceptions will be made for disabled persons with service dogs.
          Emotional support and/or therapy dogs are not designated service dogs as defined by the ADA, and thus are not
          permitted entry. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      VEHICLE RULES
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>VEHICLE CHECK: All vehicles must enter the event through the check-in station and stop for check-in staff.
          All vehicles must wait in line, even if they have been checked in previously and are returning. (Emergency
          vehicles and event staff vehicles on assigned event business excepted.)
          <br/>
          ALL vehicles at Yesteryear are subject to inspection by Yesteryear staff at ANY time, for ANY reason. It is
          our job to ensure the safety of our attendees, and that could include determining that certain vehicles are
          not safe to transport passengers, drive in certain areas, or at all.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>DRIVING: Vehicles within the grounds of the event must move at 5MPH or LESS at all times. No unsafe
          maneuvers or styles of driving that kick up dust are allowed.
          <br/>
          Avoid leaving vehicles idling near campsites, especially where people are sleeping. Driving within the 100%
          themed area is not permitted. (Usually reserved for fire and medical vehicles, Yesteryear staff vehicles
          needed for safety or operations, or vehicles that are participating in some kind of official entertainment.)
          <br/>
          Be extra careful when driving your vehicle at night near camp sites. Tent support lines can be very hard to
          see. All vehicles driving at night must use headlights. Driving outside the perimeter of the event is not
          permitted.
          <br/>
          Drinking alcohol and driving is never tolerated under any circumstances, and any incidents will be referred
          to local authorities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>PARKING: Consult the map for areas in which to park your vehicle. Parking is included in your ticket price
          and is generally allowed in designated areas as long as you do not block roads indicated on the map.
          <br/>
          Do NOT park any vehicles in the themed area after the event begins. Vehicles that need to load or unload
          within the themed area will need permission from staff.
          <br/>
          Do NOT park your vehicle anywhere outside the event perimeter. Most of the surrounding property around
          Yesteryear is private, and your vehicle could be cited or towed by law enforcement.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      WEAPONS POLICY
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>PROPS: You are allowed to bring prop weapons for your costume.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>BOWS & CROSSBOWS: Bows must NEVER be loaded while in the event area. If it is a weapon that fires a
          projectile of any kind, or makes a loud noise, do not even think of loading or shooting it off in the event
          area.  This rule includes functioning slingshots.  Non-functioning, non-elastic prop slingshots for costuming
          purposes are still fine. Bows and crossbows may only be strung/loaded while using the official archery range
          and only during supervised range open hours.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>BLADES & SHARP OBJECTS: Edged weapons should stay sheathed while you are inside the event boundaries.
          This includes sharp objects on costumes (spikes, etc.). Yesteryear security and staff reserve the right to
          inspect and confiscate any weapons or items that appear to be unsafe, or are being used in an unsafe manner
          (they will be held for you until the end of the event).
          <br/>
          We ask you not to carry or wear large or sharp objects through crowds of people. We also ask you not to carry
          large and/or dangerous objects at night, due to low visibility and foggy terrain. Please leave real weapons
          in camp after dark (like baseball bats, sheathed swords, etc.)
          <br/>
          If you have questions about a specific weapon, please ask us before you bring it out. And remember that
          California law supersedes any of our weapons policies.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      CAMP RULES
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>MUSIC & NOISE: You may only play period music and period instruments between noon and midnight at a moderate
          volume and as long as it does not disturb others. The organizers reserve the right to ask you to stop playing
          if they feel it is not contributing to the theme or is interfering with the official event audio. Quiet hours
          are between midnight and 9am.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>FIRES: We do not allow cooking fires at the premises.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="rule-section">
      REFUND POLICY
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>REFUNDS: All tickets are digital. You will not receive physical tickets. For the Yesteryear event all
          purchases are refundable until March 24th, 2023, after which no refunds will be given. Tickets, passes,
          packages, and accommodations may be transferred to another party up until April 7th, 2023.</p>
